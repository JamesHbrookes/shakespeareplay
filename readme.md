  Ok, so I know this seems complicated. Let me write out a simple list with the steps. Make this into a check list and tick them off as you go!

  - [ ] Download Atom and install in **your** Applications folder
  - [ ] Create an account on [Github.com][fc57320f]
  - [ ] Grab link on Moodle (week 1) for the GitHub template (**note:** I can't publish this on this public site)
  - [ ] Read the helper document about getting HTML from InDesign
  - [ ] Add the files into the local version of the repository and edit the HTML and CSS etc
  - [ ] Check that the site works (home page is the cover image with link to the play)
  - [ ] `push` the files to your GitHub repository
  - [ ] Configure your GitHub repository to use the `docs` folder to deliver the web site
  - [ ] Note the web address and finish
