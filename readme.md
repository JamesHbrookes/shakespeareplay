# Your Repository for your Shakespeare Play Web page
## What to do?

Now that you are seeing this go to the green button (Clone or Download)

Click on this green button and select _Clone_. Choose a location for your files. All of the files in the repository will now be available for you to edit and use.

### Editing the files
You can use a variety of editors, Textwrangler if you wish, but the one that we recommend is _Atom_. This can be found here: https://atom.io

You can install Atom on your logged-in MAC in the Tonge IT suite and this will be your own copy when you are logged in _to that MAC_. If you move to another MAC then you need to install again. Within Atom, you can install various _packages_ and _themes_.

### What's inside the repository?
When you clone this repository, you will find a variety of files, but the 2 important ones are these:

- index.xhtml - this will become the home page for your play
- style.css -  this is where you define the styles for the elements in the play

You can also have a look at the sample scene inside the **.sampleScene** folder

### Ok, so what do I do now?
Here are the steps to take:

1. Open InDesign and find your final version of the play (**only the play - not the Introduction**)
1. Make any corrections that you like (consider the comments from the previous assignment)
2. If you created any new styles you will need to go to the style panel and configure the _Export Tags_ feature.
1. Go to File>Export>HTML
1. You need only to make one change to the settings: do not include a stylesheet
2. Locate the file just exported (it will be in your downloads folder)
3. Open this file in the text editor that you chose
4. Copy all of the lines inside the /<body/> tag (don't copy the /<body/> tags themselves, only what is inside.)
5. Open the _index.xhtml_ file (that you have from your repository) with the text editor
6. Paste into this file within the /<body/> tags as per the instructions in that file.
7. Now edit the _style.css_ file to style each of the elements in the play
8. Review in a web browser
9. Validate the XHTML file here: https://validator.w3.org
10. Validate the CSS file here: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
11. Upload the 2 files to your GitHub repository
12. In GitHub go to settings for your repository
13. Under GitHub Pages choose Master for the source
14. Your web page for the play will be live!
