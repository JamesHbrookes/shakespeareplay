<h2 id="what-to-do">What to do?</h2>
<p>If you are reading this within your very own copy of this GitHub repository (because you followed the link from the <strong>github classroom</strong>), then read on. If you are reading this offline, then please set up the Github account before you do anything else.</p>
<p>Before you do anything with your new GitHub account do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to your account settings and put in your full name</li>
<li>Add a picture or avatar of yourself</li>
<li>Go to <strong>settings and change the name</strong> of your repo (you can use the name of your play, but this may conflict with others, so include your publisher or surname as well example: <em>blades-macbeth</em>)</li>
</ul>

</figure>
<p>You don't need GitHub.com for the moment, apart from reading this text, but you will need to recall your username and password during the next steps.</p>
<h3 id="your-digital-tools">Your digital tools</h3>
<p>You will need a text editor that can show and preview web HTML. We now want you to download and install <em>Atom</em>. You can find this <a href="https://atom.io" title="grab Atom">free open source editor here</a></p>
<figure>
<img src="images/2017/01/downloadAtom.png" alt="Download Atom" /><figcaption>Download Atom</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This application will be placed inside your downloads folder, so you need to copy to your <em>Applications</em> folder inside you user account on the MAC. This means that you should try to use the same MAC in Tonge whenever possible.</p>
<p>You can also install this on your own computer at home.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/2017/01/yourHomefolder.png" alt="Finding your Applications folder" /><figcaption>Finding your Applications folder</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Your Applications folder is inside your Home folder; find this by selecting <em>Go</em> from the finder menu. You can copy or move the Atom app from the downloads folder.</p>
<p>Atom will now be available but we now need to move to the next stage.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Configuring Atom</h4>
<p>Atom is open source, so this means there are lots of packages that can be added to provide extra functionality. What follows is <strong>rather advanced</strong>, so don't worry if you can't do this; it is only another option.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Here are a few packages that will prove useful:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Atom HTML Preview</li>
<li>toolbar (suda)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You can optionally use Atom to update your GitHub repository that is online. To do this you need to install this package:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Git-Plus</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Then in the terminal window copy and paste this:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><code>git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain</code></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You should now be able to <em>push</em> your updates direct to GitHub and see the results on your web site.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The MACs have installed an application called <em>GitHub Desktop</em>. Find this in the launchpad. If you want to install this on your own computer, it is free and <a href="https://desktop.github.com" title="grab GithUb Desktop">comes from here</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Open the GitHub Desktop APP</li>
<li>It will show a tutorial that you can come back to if you wish.</li>
<li>You now need to login with your GitHub account</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="images/2017/01/providetourLoginDetailsfromGitHub.png" alt="Login Details from GitHub" /><figcaption>Login Details from GitHub</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once you have done this you can now <em>clone</em> the repository that is in your GitHub account online by selecting the <strong>+</strong> sign. All being well you should see something similar to this here:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/2017/01/clone.png" alt="Choose you repo" /><figcaption>Choose you repo</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li>You will be asked where to put itâ€¦. your Google drive is best! Stay in the GitHub desktop app:</li>
<li>In the GitHub desktop right-click over the repo name in the left sidebar and select <strong>Open in Atom</strong></li>
</ul>
<figure>

<li>You should see something like this:</li>

<h3 id="whats-inside-the-repository">What's inside the repository?</h3>
<p>When you download this repository, you will find a variety of files, but the 2 important ones are inside the <strong>docs</strong> folder:</p>
<ul>
<li>index.xhtml - this will become the home page for your play. This page will have the cover image.</li>
<li>play.xhtml - this is where the text of the play will be. Linked from the home page above.</li>
<li>styles.css - this is where you define the styles for the elements in the play</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also have a look at the sample scene inside the <strong>sampleScene</strong> folder</p>
<ul>
<li>Also inside the resources folder you will find various InDesign scripts. These scripts needs to go into your copy of InDesign. <a href="resources/README.md" title="help with the scripts">The instructions are available here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ok-so-what-do-i-do-now">Ok, so what do I do now?</h2>
<p>Here are the steps to take:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open InDesign and find your final version of the play (<strong>only the play - not the Introduction</strong>)</li>
<li>Make any corrections that you like (consider the comments from the previous assignment)</li>
<li>If you created any new styles you will need to go to the style panel and configure the <em>Export Tags</em> feature.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="images/2017/01/export_tagging.png" alt="Export Tagging" /><figcaption>Export Tagging</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li>Now run the script (export_XHTML). You should see something like this:</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="images/2017/01/export_toXHTML.png" alt="Running the script export to XHTML" /><figcaption>Running the script export to XHTML</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li>You will find that you have now got a new file saved wherever your InDesign file was saved. You can drag this file into your working copy of the repo that you have open in Atom.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-play">The Play</h3>
<p>In Atom it will look similar to this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/2017/01/yourexportedplay.png" alt="XHTML version of the play" /><figcaption>XHTML version of the play</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li>Copy all of the lines including the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> opening and closing tag. You can make this easier by <em>collapsing</em> the body tag:</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="images/2017/01/copycollapsedBody_tag.png" alt="Copy the body tag when collapsed" /><figcaption>Copy the body tag when collapsed</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li>Open the <em>play.xhtml</em> file that is inside the docs folder (that you have from your repository) with <strong>Atom</strong></li>
<li>Paste into this file and overwrite the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag as per the instructions in that file.</li>
<li>Now edit the <em>style.css</em> file (again inside the docs folder) to style each of the elements in the play</li>
<li>Review in a web browser</li>
<li>Validate the XHTML file here: https://validator.w3.org</li>
<li>Validate the CSS file here: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-home-page-cover">The home page cover</h3>
<ul>
<li>You now need the cover image from the book.</li>
<li>You can open the PDF of the cover in Photoshop and crop down to the front of the cover. In other words, remove the back and spine.</li>
<li>The cover image needs to be 1400 pixels wide, because we need this later for the eBook.</li>
<li>save this image as a JPEG in the <strong>images</strong> folder within the <strong>docs</strong> folder in your repository that you downloaded from GitHub.</li>
<li>Now edit the index.xhtml file and put the file name of the image where instructed in the markup. Also edit the ALT tag text.</li>
<li>When you view this index.xhtml file the image will be very large, so you must edit the styles.css file to change the width of the image.</li>
<li>when viewed in a browser, this image will be a link to the play.</li>
<li>check that these work.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="making-the-web-site-work">Making the web site work</h3>
<p><strong>When you are happy</strong> with the look of these web pages then you can: - Upload these new versions of these files to your GitHub repository - You do this by using GitHub Desktop and select <em>Sync</em> top right. - In GitHub go to settings for your repository - Under GitHub Pages choose the <strong>docs folder</strong> for the source</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/2017/01/choose_docsfolder.png" alt="docs" /><figcaption>docs</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li>Your web page for the play will be live!</li>
<li>When you have finished and are ready then post the URL of your site to the moodle assignment location.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Please note: </strong>all of this will be demonstrated in class and there will also be a screencast available</p>
