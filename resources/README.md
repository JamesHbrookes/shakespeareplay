# Some extra texts

This folder contains some scripts for use with InDesign and 2 text files.

The _synopsis.md_ file lists all of the pays with a short description and detals about performance etc. You can extract for your play.

The _lambstales.txt_ document is by Charles and Mary Lamb, and your play may be included in this text. Use some of this if you like.

## InDesign Scripts

### splitbeforehere.jsx

This script will split the threaded story before the text box that you select.

### extractpagesandHTML.jsx

You will need to know the page range that you wish to extract. Make sure you number the pages from 1, so that you can identify the actual page range.

### How to add the script to InDesign

- You will find the script menu item under Window > Utilities > Scripts
- Now right click over **User**
- See 'Reveal in Finder'
- Now copy the script into the folder called 'Scripts Panel'
