# InDesign Scripts

Here are some scripts for InDesign.

## Export_XHTML.jsx
Use this to get an HTML version of your InDesign document. The tags that are created will depend on the _Export Tagging_ settings for each character and paragraph style.

> **Please note:** this is not the same as exporting to HTML through the menu, because that method will give you HTML not XHTML â€“and you will need to choose parameters that may not be appropriate for this task.

The following scripts are provided for later work on the _iBooks Author_ version of your play.

## splitbeforehere.jsx
Invoke this script when you have selected a text frame on a page where you want the split the story. In other words, the threading will stop before the selected frame. You need to use this if you are wanting to split out each scene or act in the play. If your scenes do not start on their own page, then you will need to change so that they do - or you can only split out at the Act level.

## extractpagesandIDML.jsx
This script will ask for a page range (please set your InDesign to start on page 1), so that it can export an IDML file and a new InDesign file from this page range.

## How to add the script to InDesign

- You will find the script menu item under Window > Utilities > Scripts
- Now right click over **User**
- See 'Reveal in Finder'
- Now copy the script into the folder called 'Scripts Panel'
