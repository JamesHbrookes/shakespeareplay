# InDesign Scripts

Here are some scripts for InDesign.

The following scripts are provided for later work on the _iBooks Author_ version of your play.

## splitbeforehere.jsx
Invoke this script when you have selected a text frame on a page where you want the split the story. In other words, the threading will stop before the selected frame. You need to use this if you are wanting to split out each scene or act in the play. If your scenes do not start on their own page, then you will need to change so that they do - or you can only split out at the Act level.

## extractpagesandIDML.jsx
This script will ask for a page range (please set your InDesign to start on page 1), so that it can export an IDML file and a new InDesign file from this page range.

## How to add the script to InDesign

- You will find the script menu item under Window > Utilities > Scripts
- Now right click over **User**
- See 'Reveal in Finder'
- Now copy the script into the folder called 'Scripts Panel'

## shakespeare.ibatemplate

This is a template for iBooks Author that provides you with a starting point for your Shakespeare play. Just double click this file and it will open in iBooks Author automatically.

You will need to change the background image (or remove entirely). Don't worry if there are errors about missing fonts, because you will need to use your own fonts.
